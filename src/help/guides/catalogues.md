# Catalogues
This category of features under the catalog page in the app allows you to change what is seen on the page.

### Sources
These are separated by the language they publish in and ordered alphabetically. At the top of the list will be your most recently accessed source
### Browse
This button allows you to enter the source with a search button and other search features such as genre filtering and sort order. It sorts by the default order that the source sets.
### Latest
This button allows you to enter the source and see the latest entries from that source without any search features. Some sources do not have this functionality, so the button does not appear on those sources

### Global search
The top right magnifying glass icon can be tapped to search every enabled source.

### Toggle displayed sources
Tapping the tap right cog will open up a page with all the sources on it. Uncheck sources to prevent them from showing up in the list when entering catalog and vice versa. Turn off languages to prevent all sources from that language from showing up in the list.
